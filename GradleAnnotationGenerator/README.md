# Gradle Build Visualization
This is a build visulization utility for Gradle-based builds, based on [ElectricInsight](http://www.electric-cloud.com/products/electricaccelerator.php?tab=ei) from [Electric Cloud](http://www.electric-cloud.com). ElectricInsight is the only tool to visually depict the structure of a software build, down to the file level. This empowers build managers to pinpoint performance problems and conflicts in a build. An add-on to ElectricAccelerator, ElectricInsight mines the information produced by ElectricAccelerator to provide an easy-to-understand, graphical representation of the build structure for performance analysis. It provides detailed information and reports on each job on each node of the build cluster, for at-a-glance diagnostics. And it can predict and model how build times would be impacted by adding nodes to the ElectricAccelerator cluster, to help guide hardware investment decisions.
