# Gradle Build Visualization
* Do you want to have better insight into what your Gradle build is doing, and how it is performing? 
* Are you exploring the incubating parallel feature of Gradle and want to understand how well it is performing? 
* Are you a Gradle plugin developer and want a better understanding on how your plugin performs when integrated into your Gradle builds? 

The GradleAnnotationGenerator is a build visulization utility for Gradle-based builds, based on [ElectricInsight](http://www.electric-cloud.com/products/electricaccelerator.php?tab=ei) from [Electric Cloud](http://www.electric-cloud.com). The below screenshot is from the gradle build of Gradle itself, more details below:

### ElectricInsight
ElectricInsight is a powerful tool to visually depict the structure of a software build, down to the file level - empowering build managers to pinpoint performance problems and conflicts in a build. The default usage of ElectricInsight is as an add-on to [ElectricAccelerator](http://www.electric-cloud.com/products/electricaccelerator.php), mining the information produced by ElectricAccelerator to provide an easy-to-understand, graphical representation of the build structure for performance analysis. It provides detailed information and reports on each job on each parallel worker of the build infrastructure, for at-a-glance diagnostics. It can also predict and model how build times would be impacted by adding additional build infrastructure, to help guide hardware investment decisions.
