This is the documenation for how to develop PyAnnolib source code.


The Unit Tests
==============

To run the unit tests, simply run:

$ ./unittest

To add to the unit tests, add a new module to the utlib directory,
and imporat its TestCase sub-class(es) in the main "unittest" script
(see the examples in it).

There are helper routines in utlib/util.py for running commands, if
needed.

Annotation files used for the unit tests can be put into the utfiles
directory


The unit test framework is built to work with Jenkins and JUnitXML.
A zipped copy of JUnitXML is included; it's a Python library for
producing JUnit-compatible XML test results directly from the
"unittest" Python module. More info at:

    https://github.com/kyrus/python-junit-xml

If "unittest" sees it is running under Hudson or Jenkins,
it will create a "unittest.xml" file in the current directory.
