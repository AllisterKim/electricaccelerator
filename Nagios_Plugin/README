 Nagios plugin setup

   The plugin requires authentication with the Cluster Manager in order
   to access agent data. For simplicity it is hard coded the
   authenticate using the user "nagios", with the password "nagios". It
   is reccommended that this user be created to have very minimal
   permissions. It only needs read access to the server, and only to
   agent information.
